Migration has recently been a hot subject among politicians, experts, and the general public. With the continuous discussion over migration policies and their impact on the country, there is a rising demand for comprehensive and accessible visualizations of migration data to better comprehend the trends and implications of migration in Australia.</p>

          <h2>1.1 Background and Motivation</h2>
          <p>Migration, as a social phenomenon, is multidimensional and affects various facets of a nation. Its impacts are discernible in Australia's demographic composition, economic growth, cultural diversity, and even policy making processes. However, the process of understanding these impacts requires a large amount of data, which can be hard for many people to understand.</p>
          <p>This is where our visualization comes in. We designed this report for people to easily visualize, whether you are a policymaker, researcher, or student or even someone that is interested in the complexities of migration of Australia.</p>
          <p>With a focus on clarity and comprehensibility, our visualization presents migration data in a user-friendly format. It allows users to readily gain insights into the origins of migrants, their demographic characteristics, and how migration influences the Australian economy and society.</p>
          <p>Beyond serving as an informative tool, our visualization aims to stimulate informed discussions and support evidence based decision making. By highlighting the different aspects of migration, we aim to help people better understand this complex issue, fostering not just knowledge, but also empathy and a broader viewpoint.</p>

          <h2>1.2 Visualization Purpose</h2>
          <p>Australia is a well-known country with a long history of welcoming migrants from all over the world, so  that migration is a hot and recent topic in Australia.</p>
          <p>These visualizations below will help researchers, policymakers have various insights into how migrants contributed to the well-being of Australia. Furthermore, there would be some tools added that help users interact with the data to help it be more realistic. For instance, users can use visualized charts to identify the main source countries for migrants to Australia and track changes in the number of migrants over time. Line charts are useful for people to analyze the demographic characteristics of migrants, such as age, and gender. By understanding these characteristics, policy makers and researchers are able to identify potential challenges and opportunities related to the integration of migrants into Australian society and the labor market.</p>
          <p>Moreover, these visualizations will also provide various insights into how migration benefits the Australian economy, workforce, and population growth. The impact on the economic and socialization could play an important role in migration as it is the important key for policy makers that responsible for making decisions about resource allocation, infrastructure planning as well as the aspects of economic policy.</p>
          <p>Overall, a geographical map will be a valuable resource for anyone that is interested in understanding the complexities of migration in Australia and its impact on the country's society, economy, as well as cultural diversity. Therefore, Australia is ranked among the worldâ€™s best countries to be an immigrant.</p>
